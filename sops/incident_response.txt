An incident response plan outlines the steps to take when a security incident occurs to minimize damage and recover quickly.

Incident Response Lifecycle:
1. Preparation:
   - Define roles and responsibilities.
   - Maintain updated contact lists and communication plans.
2. Detection & Analysis:
   - Monitor logs, alerts, and system behavior.
   - Confirm the incident and determine its nature and scope.
3. Containment:
   - Short-Term: Isolate affected systems to prevent spread.
   - Long-Term: Apply patches and change configurations.
4. Eradication:
   - Remove malware, unauthorized users, and backdoors.
   - Identify root cause and fix vulnerabilities.
5. Recovery:
   - Restore systems to normal operations.
   - Monitor for signs of weaknesses or reinfection.
6. Lessons Learned:
   - Conduct a post-mortem.
   - Update incident response and security posture.

Every step should be logged and time-stamped for audit and legal purposes.
